Ponderosa pine,eFUELBED_DESCRIPTION,Mesic to wet savannas with very open,Mixed Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine conifer forests of the northern U.S. Rocky Mountains. Fire exclusion has created elevated levels of hazardous fuels.,This eastern Oregon site has a mix of sagebrush (Artemesia spp.) and bitterbrush (Purshia tridentata) with scattered western juniper. Fire exclusion has resulted in western juniper encroachment into the sagebrush assemblage. Sagebrush shrublands are widespread throughout the Great Basin,Tidal marsh vegetation occurring on the Atlantic coast from Maine to northeastern Florida and along the Gulf Coast to Texas dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus).,Tidal marsh vegetation occurring on the Atlantic coast from Maine to northeastern Florida and along the Gulf Coast to Texas dominated by smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus).,Black spruce forest fuelbed with a feathermoss forest floor,High pocosin shrublands range from Virginia south to Florida on the coastal plain. High pocosin is an evergreen and deciduous shrub bog with emergent trees over a dense shrub understory on organic soils (peat) less than 5 feet deep. The canopy stratum is dominated by pond pine and loblolly bay. Age ranges from 20 to 60 years since fire.,Eastern white pine and northern red oak are dominant with red maple as a common canopy associate.
