# Landfire Disturbance

### Purpose/Description: Specifications and scripts to modify fuelbeds to reflect a disturbance to the corresponding landscape

### Building
The fbrw_library directory is c++ source code to build a shared library with python bindings. Use bjam to build.

Note: I was able to build on Windows, but the dll name was not compatible as is. Needs more work if windows build is necessary.
